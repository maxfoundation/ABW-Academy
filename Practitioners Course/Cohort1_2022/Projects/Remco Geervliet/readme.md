## Data Quality Checks and New Analysis on Determinants on Child Stunting

******* TO BE FILLED BEFORE November 04, 2022 ***********

#### Background information
Max Foundation has the goal of ensuring every child has a healthy start in life. It works towards this goal by implementing integrated programmes in Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), Nutrition and care. The main indicator used to track child health is the stunting rate, which compares children's height and age to a WHO benchmark. Though a low stunting rate is expected everywhere, in Bangladesh the national rate stands above 30% and the areas where Max implements its programmes are likely to be affected even worse.
To measure the impact of its programmes, Max Foundation has taken height and weight measurements of over 75,000 children. And as it has done so over time, measuring every child ideally quarterly, it has collected over 500,000 data points. All children can be linked to their households, which in turn can be linked to their village. 


#### Goal of the project
The goal of the project is twofold.
First, though over 75,000 children have been measured, there are more children who live in the area and the observed children may differ on key characteristics from the population. A key question is therefore whether a link can be established between observables in the under-5 population and the sample. 
This comparison will be made by combining polygon data on the number of under-5 children in Bangladesh with other polygon data on a wealth index. This data can then be matched to the data collected by Max Foundation by aggregating children in similar polygons. This matching will create an overview of the overall coverage of child data, which will be a proxy for the quality and coverage of the data.

Second, even though the observed children may differ on observables from the under-5 population, this does not necessarily mean the observed stunting rate will be different from the expected stunting rate. The second line of investigation will therefore see whether a multilevel model, trained on the data, will create a different stunting rate when used to predict the stunting rate in the population. 

#### Who will be using the results of this project and for making what decisions?
The data will not be directly used in decision-making. However, it will provide further evidence to the quality of the data collected and its representitativeness. As the collected data is purely observational, and the observed children are not a random sample, proving the respresentativeness of the data is key to strengthening the evidence of the impact Max Foundation has had.

#### Expected Deliverables
- A dataset which combines the differently-sized polygon data from the two datasets mentioned above
- A model that compares the coverage of Max Foundation in each polygon
- A model that extrapolates the observed stunting rate to the expected stunting rate in the population
